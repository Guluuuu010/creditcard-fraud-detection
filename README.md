# creditcard-fraud-detection

This repository contains a credit card fraud detection project prepared for GitHub.
It includes preprocessing, modeling, evaluation code, and a Streamlit app for demo.

**Structure**
- `data/` - placeholder for dataset (`creditcard.csv`)
- `notebooks/` - analysis notebook (`analysis.ipynb`)
- `src/` - reusable python modules (data_preprocessing, model_training, evaluation, utils)
- `models/` - saved model & scaler placeholders
- `app/` - Streamlit app (`streamlit_app.py`)
- `requirements.txt` - python dependencies
- `.gitignore` - common ignores

> Note: The `data/creditcard.csv` file is a placeholder. Replace it with your real dataset before running the notebooks or app.
